Microsoft Authentication Library
=====================================

| [Getting Started](https://aka.ms/aaddev)| [Sample Code](https://aka.ms/aaddev) | [API Reference](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/MSAL/) | [Support](README.md#community-help-and-support)
| --- | --- | --- | --- |


The MSAL library for **platform** gives your app the ability to begin using the [Microsoft Cloud](https://cloud.microsoft.com) by supporting [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) and [Microsoft Accounts](https://account.microsoft.com) in a converged experience using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. The library also supports [Azure AD B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory-b2c/).

## Important Note about the MSAL Preview

These libraries are suitable to use in a production environment. We provide the same production level support for these libraries as we do our current production libraries. During the preview we reserve the right to make changes to the API, cache format, and other mechanisms of this library without notice which you will be required to take along with bug fixes or feature improvements  This may impact your application.  For instance, a change to the cache format may impact your users, such as requiring them to sign in again and an API change may require you to update your code. When we provide our General Availability release later, we will require you to update your application to our General Availabilty version within six months to continue to get support.

## Example

This is a 

`few lines of sample code to call the API. Should be aquireToken for whatever platform. Nothing more.`

and larger documentation should go below, but really should be in docs.

## Installation

A few sentences about how to use a package manager to install the library. Also shouldn't go in to deep detail.

## Security Library

This library controls how users sign-in and access services. We recommend you always take the latest version of our library in your app when possible. We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) so you can control the risk associated with updating your app. As an example, always downloading the latest minor version number (e.g. x.*y*.x) ensures you get the latest security and feature enhanements but our API surface remains the same. You can always see the latest version and release notes under the Releases tab of GitHub.

## Security Reporting

If you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible. Your submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [Microsoft Bounty](http://aka.ms/bugbounty) program. Please do not post security issues to GitHub Issues or any other public site. We will contact you shortly upon receiving the information. We encourage you to get notifications of when security incidents occur by visiting [this page](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948) and subscribing to Security Advisory Alerts.
